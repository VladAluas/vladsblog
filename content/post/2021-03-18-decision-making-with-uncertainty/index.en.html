<p><strong>Insert Lead paragraph here.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>People engage in decision making on a daily basis and although most of our decisions seem to derive from logical arguments, the truth is that exactly the opposite is true. Most of the decisions we make are due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">biases</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic">heuristics</a> our minds have developed to respond to the environment around them faster.</p>
<p>These tendencies have been first described and studied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky">Amos Tversky</a> and <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/kahneman/home">Daniel Kahneman</a> and have been explained in Kahneman’s excellent book <em>Thinking fast and slow</em>. I highly recommend the book since it is an excellent guide in where our minds tend to be error prone and mislead us. I will explain in brief however that our minds operate as two separate system called by Kahneman and Tversky <em>system 1</em> and <em>system 2</em>.</p>
<p><em>System 1</em> is the default system of the mind, the one used for everyday activities. These activities include walking, breathing, detecting danger and avoiding it, eating, doing routine activities, and all activities that do not involve heavy cognitive effort. <em>System 1</em> is emotional, automatic, fast and uses no extra energy from our energy hungry brains.</p>
<p><em>System 2</em> is the exact opposite of <em>System 1</em>. It is rational, quite slow, and requires a large amount of energy and effort from our part. <em>System 2</em> allows you to analyse in detail every situation, however this is not always ideal. If a car would come speeding towards you, <em>System 2</em> would analyse the colour of the car, the brand and maybe the speed and approach vector, which is a nice thought exercise but might get hit by the car before <em>System 2</em> would act. <em>System 1</em> will not bother with all those details, it will just register car coming towards me with great speed, I need to move out of the way.</p>
<p>The problem when making decisions is that there are situations moderated or mediated by the aforementioned biases and heuristics in which <em>System 1</em> might make the decision and our minds might think it is actually <em>System 2</em>. Otherwise said, we might make decisions for subjective reasons and have a high degree of confidence in then believing they are objective.</p>
<p>In this article I would like to show some methods that can reduce these types of biases and help in engaging <em>System 2</em> in the decision making process.</p>
<div id="distribution-types" class="section level1">
<h1>Distribution Types</h1>
<p>I would like to start with some examples how some situations can seem similar on the surface and have massively different outcomes. This is one of the most common situations in which <em>System 1</em> makes the decision and we might not notice.</p>
<p>I would like to start with some examples as it is way easier. Let us say we are at a music festival (I know, I know…) together with 9,998 other people. We are lucky enough to have information about this crowd and we know that the average age is 24.5 years old. We also know that the average net income for the crowd is $65K. With this information at our disposal we can play around with the impact of one person.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like you to think of the oldest person you know. It does not have to be alive any more. What would happen if we were to add their age to the average? Since I cannot read your mind, I will jump in with the oldest person that pops to my mind, Methuselah at a respectable 969 years old. So, let’s see the impact of Methuselah on the average age.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m_{age} = \frac{10,000 \times 24.5 + 969}{10,001} = 24.5944406\]</span></p>
<p>Not much of an impact, is it?</p>
<p>Secondly, let us try the same impact for net worth. Think of the richest person you know and try to figure out what would their impact be on the crowd, how much will the average change?</p>
<p>I’m thinking of Elon Musk although at the time of writing this article he is worth a measly $169B as opposed to Jeff Bezos’ $193B. I’m a fan of Musk so let’s check with his net worth.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[m_{net\_worth} = \frac{10,000 \times 65,000 + 169,000,000,000}{10,001} = \$16,963,304\]</span></p>
<p>Quite a difference, right? I’d say so.</p>
<p>This difference is because the two characteristics of the music enthusiasts population follow two different distribution types. The first example follows a normal distribution while the second one follows a power law distribution.</p>
<p>Some basic characteristics of population distribution will be essential in our analysis, so I will take a few moments to explain the two types of distribution I mentioned earlier, although a distribution can have many other variations.</p>
<div id="normal-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
<p>As mentioned above the age of the music enthusiasts is distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally</a>. A normal distribution is a phenomenon observed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Gauss</a> and it can help us a lot in our analysis due to its <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/">properties.</a></p>
<p>A normal distribution means that most individuals in a population are close to the average and the further we go from the average the fewer individuals in the population. If we take height as an example, most people will be around average height in a population and the ones that are extremely tall or extremely short being a rarity. The more extreme the height (taller or shorter) the less likely to find someone with that height.</p>
<p>If a population has an average height of 1.75m (5.74 ft), you will have an easier time finding someone who is 1.9m (6.2 ft) than someone who is 2.13m (7 ft). Also the chances of finding someone who is 7km (4.3 mi) tall is virtually zero.</p>
<p>This is a good thing because it allows us to asses a population quite easy using a sample. Even if our estimates based on the sample are off, if the sample was not biased, we can be fairly certain that we will not be off by much.</p>
<p>Data that falls under a normal distribution are usually the ones that measure natural phenomena. They can include but not be limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>height</li>
<li>weight</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>reaction times</li>
<li>average time spent playing video games</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="power-law-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Power Law Distribution</h2>
<p>The other effect we have observed is called a power law distribution, or for those who work in the financial sector a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto Distribution</a>, and I think it is best know as the <em>80-20 rule</em> most commonly remembered as: “20% of the people control 80% of the assets.”</p>
<p>This type of distribution can masquerade itself as a normal distribution but is not. It has a lot of dwarves and a few giants and that is why you cannot make any estimations using any of the normal distribution indicators. If you take a sample of dwarves you cannot estimate the impact of a giant.</p>
<p>Ignoring this fact is why we have a lot of people calling themselves actors, writers or singers and not what they actually do for a living, most likely bartenders, waiters or other job unrelated with their self-reported career.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributions-in-decision-making" class="section level2">
<h2>Distributions in Decision Making</h2>
<p>Here is where it is important to know a bit about distributions.</p>
<p>If I were to propose a bet in which you are allowed to sample 100 people from the festival mentioned earlier and give some information about the population based on that sample, in which bets you would engage?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Education level</li>
<li>Number of cars owned</li>
<li>Amount of beer drunk weekly</li>
</ol>
<p>I would go for education level since it is highly unlikely someone has spent 50 years in education. And even if it is so, the impact to 10,000 will be small. The same goes for amount of beer drunk weekly. If there is someone who drinks thousands of beer weekly you might be in trouble, but not as much as they are. I think you would be safe with that bet.</p>
<p>But what about the amount of cars? Well, here it can get a bit tricky. Most people have one or two cars. But what happens if in the crowd is the Sultan of Brunei with a car collection of 7000 cars? Considering the low age of the crowd, it is possible that he owns more cars that the whole crowd put together. This would not be a problem if you can include him in the sample however a sample of 100 people out of 10,000 give you a chance of 1% to include him in it. This means that most 99 out of 100 times your sample will underestimate the average number of cars owned by the crowd.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to try and figure out what kind of distribution has the population to which you are trying to make a decision and adjust your decision making accordingly. In the following section I will describe a problem which would be interesting to solve, what career would be best if I were to choose again, and see how we can take advantage of these distributions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>In the next section I would like to show in brief what would be my thought process if I were to choose a career once more and assuming that I have the knowledge I have now.</p>
<p>First of all I would need to know what do I expect from a career, money, fame, free time, all of those? There can be multiple variables analysed here, however for the sake of simplicity I will keep it short and analyse just one. So, in this analysis the most important factor in choosing a career is how much income can this career generate during a person working life.</p>
<p>Now, what careers are on the short list?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first option would be doctor. This is a good option in my opinion as it is supposed to be well paid, and one can find work almost everywhere. Wherever there are people, there are sick people and a doctor will always be in demand. A medical career offers a lot of variety in both specialities and type of practice which is always good to have.</li>
<li>The second career option would be one in IT. This is also rumoured to be well paid and besides that it can give one a lot of puzzles with which to play. I like challenges and spending time figuring out puzzles so this seems a good choice for me. As a bonus, any mistakes made as a programmer can be easily patched and fixed, and most mistakes made by programmers do not endanger anyone’s life, as opposed to a doctor’s mistake.</li>
<li>The third option is one that is highly appealing because it can generate a lot of income with minimal effort. This is on the surface and it remains to be seen when we analyse the data. The career is poker player. I like the idea to create my own schedule and work when I want from where I want. It remains to be seen if this is such an appealing option as it seems at first.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-method" class="section level1">
<h1>The method</h1>
<p>Everything in nature is subject to variety so we will assume that the income will vary as based on different factors. Therefore we cannot generate a single number and say <em>“There! this is the expected income if you choose this career!”</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, if I were to choose to study medicine, I might have an idea of what kind of doctor I want to be, however that does not guarantee that I will end up in that particular field. I might not like the field once I go into the nifty gritty of it, or I might like another field more once I find out more about it. Since I cannot control that I will try to simulate multiple outcomes and see overall which career is the best taking into account its highs and lows.</p>
<p><em>E.g.:</em> If I were to choose between being a janitor who just won the lottery and being a doctor, I would chose to be the janitor. However, if I were to chose between the two and live 10,000 I would choose the doctor because the other 9,999 time it is the better outcome.</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
<p>We will gather data on each of the three career paths we have chosen and we will analyse it to try and figure out which are the main characteristics of the three populations, doctors, IT workers, and poker players. We will try to find out what is the average salary, how much does it usually vary from there, and if there is a tendency of most salaries to e over or under that average. Once we have all this information, we will extract a sample of that data of 10,000 randomly chosen salaries.</p>
<p>The salary information will be from the Romanian job market since I am based in Tomania.</p>
<div id="coding-examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Coding examples</h2>
<p>Since we are analysing data we will need a tool that will allow us to do so. I will use <em>R</em> since it is a versatile tool that will allow us to create distributions and visualise then quite easily. The code can be completely ignored if you do not want to reproduce or analyse it, you can just focus on the graphs and the results. If you want to learn more about <em>R</em> I would recommend <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>, a brilliant book that is the perfect starting place.</p>
<p>Let’s start coding. At first I would like to set up the variables that I will use in this article. Since we will use these values multiple times in the article, I will store them here and if we need to adjust them at a later date, I can just change the values once, in here.</p>
<p>The first values we want to encode are the average salaries. At the moment you can ignore the values, they will make sense when we come to the analysis itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Medical Salaries
dr_sal_mean &lt;- 21100

# IT Salaries
it_sal_med_high &lt;- 225000 # Median Salary for Managers and Directors in IT
it_sal_med_low  &lt;- 92809  # Median Salary for the everyone else working in IT </code></pre>
<p>The salaries are encoded in here not later when we are analysing the careers themselves because it is a good practice to keep the variables in one place and the same goes for custom function. I will add some in here as well. This functions just store some lines of code that we will need to repeat over and over again and it is good coding practice to store such lines of code in one function so you can avoid having too many lines of code. Also, if we want to change something at a later date, we just need to adjust everything in one place.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Graphical function to avoid writing the same lines over and over
histogram &lt;- function(.df){
  
  .df %&gt;% 
    tibble() %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(.)) +
    geom_histogram(colour = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;#2484cc&quot;) +
    labs(x = &quot;Income&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(prefix = &quot;€&quot;))
    #theme_void()+
    #theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#1A2E40&quot;, color = NA),
    #      strip.text.x = element_text(family = &quot;oswald&quot;, face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = 12, color = &quot;#D8E6F2&quot;))
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Just a simple function to format the Romanian currency so I can used stored variables.
ron_format &lt;- function(.x){
  require(scales)
  
  dollar_format(prefix = &quot;&quot;, suffix = &quot; RON&quot;)(.x)
}</code></pre>
<p>With this out of the way, we have everything we need set up. The only thing that remains is to start analysing each career and then comparing them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-careers" class="section level1">
<h1>The careers</h1>
<div id="the-doctor-of-the-medicine-not-who-variety" class="section level2">
<h2>The Doctor (of the medicine not Who variety)</h2>
<p>Being a doctor is a well respected career in all societies and it tends to be well paid and our target job market, Romania, is not exception to this.</p>
<p>Even though doctors are well paid in Romania, their income varies depending on different factors like the speciality, experience, degree level and many more. My purpose in the next section is to figure out:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the average salary for a doctor in Romania</li>
<li>What is the variation from the average</li>
<li>What is the distribution of those salaries</li>
</ol>
<p>After I have this information, I can apply all the necessary transformations to have the lifetime earnings of a doctor expressed in Euro(€).</p>
<p>Before I can do all that I will need a data source and finding it can get frustrating. Although there are a lot of websites that offer this information, they are not always reliable, so I prefer to use official databases (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat">eurostat</a>), scholarly articles, or websites that offer transparency regarding their sources.</p>
<p>For this particular situation, I have found <a href="http://www.salaryexplorer.com/salary-survey.php?loc=178&amp;loctype=1&amp;job=13&amp;jobtype=2">salaryexplorer.com</a>. I believe they are reliable in their claims and their sources can be seen at the bottom of the <a href="http://www.salaryexplorer.com/">page.</a>. The displayed salaries are in the local Romanian currency, RON, before tax. Applying the tax and converting to € will be easy once I have determined the larger problems mentioned earlier, <em>average salary</em>, <em>variation</em>, and <em>distribution.</em></p>
<p>The first part is the easiest to figure out. The average salary is mentioned in the beginning of the article, 21,100 RON.</p>
<p>Fortunately, due to the website the second and third questions are quite easily answered as well. Most salaries vary between 7,750 RON and 35,600 RON. Now, all I need to do is figure out the distribution of those salaries.</p>
<p>The fact that the salaries are between 7,750 RON and 35,600 RON and taking a look at the list provided with the salaries for specific jobs I can conclude that the salaries are not distributed according to a power law so they are distributed normally, or as close as normal as to make not much of a difference. Since I am not dealing with a power law I can be pretty confident that even if I am off, I will not be off by much.</p>
<p>With this said, let’s create our sample and take a look at it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dr_sal_dist &lt;- rnorm(10000, dr_sal_mean, sd = 5000)

dr_sal_dist %&gt;% 
    histogram() +
    labs(title = &quot;Monthly Income Distribution&quot;,
         subtitle = &quot;Medical Professionals&quot;) + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(prefix = &quot;&quot;, suffix = &quot;RON&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>The graphic above is a simple representation of how many people earn a specific amount on a monthly basis. As it is expected from a normal, or near normal distribution, most people earn close to the average while a few have extremely high earnings or extremely low earnings.</p>
<p>Now that I have the distribution simulated, I can proceed with the transformation of the data so I will have the salaries in € and calculate the earnings for a lifetime. For that I will need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deduce the taxes on these salaries</li>
<li>Determine how many salaries does a doctor receive in a lifetime</li>
<li>Convert everything to €</li>
</ol>
<p>The Romanian government imposes taxes on the on the employee as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retirement Tax: 25%</li>
<li>Health Insurance: 10%</li>
<li>Income tax on the remainder of 65% of the Gross salary: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be translated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ m_{salary(RON)} = (21,100 - \frac{25}{100} \times 21,100 - \frac{10}{100} \times 21,100) \times \frac{90}{100} = 13,715 \times \frac{90}{100} = 12,343.50\]</span>
This give me the net salary received by a doctor in Romania. All there is now to do is calculate how many such salaries one doctor receives. In Romania medical school lasts for 7 years and afterwards one needs to spend 3 to 5 years in residency. Since residency is paid I will include it in my analysis and I will consider that a doctor starts working when they start their residency. Since most people finish high-school at 19 and med school is 7 years, I will consider that one starts working at 26.</p>
<p>Since I do not plan to work more than I need to, I plan on retiring with the first chance I get. In Romania the retirement age is 65 so I will plan for that. From 26 to 65 there are 39 years of work, multiply that by 12 months I can expect to work for around 468 months.</p>
<p>And for the conversion to €, that is quite easy. According to the National Bank of Romania, the conversion rate is 1 RON for 0.20 € so all I need to do is divide the number by 5. So, let’s code everything:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># First, I will need to extract the taxes so I can compare just the NET salaries
dr_sal_final &lt;- (dr_sal_dist * 0.65) * 0.9

# Now I want to transform them in LIFELONG earnings
dr_sal_final &lt;- dr_sal_final * 468

# And finally, the conversion to €
dr_sal_final &lt;- dr_sal_final / 5  </code></pre>
<p>I will take a look at the numbers in the analysis part, this si just the preparation of the data. Now, let’s see if we can estimate how much does an IT professional earn.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-of-the-it-crowd" class="section level2">
<h2>Part of the IT Crowd</h2>
<p>Fortnately for me, Romania has one of the most active IT sectors in this part of Europe and it is expanding continuously. This is a good thing for someone looking to start on this career path because it offers a lot of opportunities</p>
<hr />
<p>Romania has one of the most active IT sectors in Eastern Europe and it is expanding continuously which is a good thing because one will not have problems ending up in an IT job if he wants to. We will just need some data on the salaries of the IT crowd. A beautiful analysis on 1,267 salaries can be seen <a href="https://www.averagesalarysurvey.com/romania">here</a>.</p>
<p>The sample is large enough to give us a good estimate of what the population actually looks like. We can see that the data is a bit skewed and slightly more people are just under the mean when it comes to income. This is due to the fact that managers and directors have very high salaries and they move the average up. This can be easily fixed, we just need to estimate what percentage of people working in IT are managers or directors and and account for that.</p>
<p>The first table gives us most of the information we need regarding the salary distribution in Romania. There we can see that most people, over 58% earn more than 92,809 RON. This is not exactly the median of the distribution however it is close enough so we will use this to approximate the shape of the distribution. The median is the value exactly in the middle of the distribution.</p>
<p>Once we have this, we will use it as an average value for a normal distribution that will contain most of the values in our population. This will be 85% percent of our lives, we will not be managers, therefore we will have salaries accordingly. In the rest of 15% of our 10,000 lives, we will be managers or directors so our salary will be accordingly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>it_sal_low &lt;- rnorm(8500, it_sal_med_low, 25000)
it_sal_high &lt;- rnorm(1500, it_sal_med_high, 50000)

it_sal_dist &lt;- c(it_sal_low, it_sal_high)

# We want to make sure the mean of our distribution if not far off from the actual distribution
mean(it_sal_dist)</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; [1] 112857.7</code></pre>
<p>We can see the average salary of our distribution is quite close to the one from the website, so we can say that our distribution closely resembles the sampled population from the site. Salary distribution looks like below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>it_sal_dist %&gt;% 
  histogram() +
  labs(title = &quot;Yearly Income Distribution&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;IT Workers&quot;) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar(prefix = &quot;&quot;, suffix = &quot;RON&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/it_yearly_salary-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Not very normal, is it? There are a few people that have huge salaries compared to the rest of the population. So, if you manage to land yourself a management role in IT you’re all set. If not, let’s see how this translates in EURO and in lifetime earnings.</p>
<p>The first thing would be to transform everything into net profit.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing the IT workers were exempt from the income tax so the only two taxes required to be paid are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security: 25%</li>
<li>Health Insurance: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards, we will convert it to Euro.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>it_sal_dist_net &lt;- it_sal_dist - (it_sal_dist * 0.25) - (it_sal_dist * 0.1)

it_sal_dist_net_eur &lt;- it_sal_dist_net * 0.2</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the yearly salary. So, for how long can someone work in this industry?</p>
<p>Most people start while studying at university, however most of those positions are either very low paying or are unpaid internships so I will eliminate them. On the other hand, due to this, most people can find work right after finishing their studies. Assuming as we did previously that someone finishes high school at 19, they can study for 3-4 years, depends if you are studying in the Bologna system or not, you can start work at 22. However, since there are a lot of people working in IT who do not have specialisations in IT, I will consider that the most typical person will start at 25. This will account for those people as most people not from IT might start later.</p>
<p>Considering that my goal is to retire at 65, I have 40 years of work ahead of me, so all I need to do is multiply everything by 40.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>it_sal_dist_net_eur &lt;- it_sal_dist_net_eur * 40

it_sal_dist_net_eur %&gt;% 
  histogram() +
  labs(title = &quot;Lifelong Income Distribution&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;IT Workers&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/it_sal_lifelong_income-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This looks decent enough. Not as good as a doctors, however not bad at all. Now, I would like to take into account one more part.</p>
<p>What if I develop an app and make it big with it?</p>
<p>Honestly, I checked for relevant statistics regarding the success of an app. You can read a very interesting summary in this <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/24/your-chances-of-making-a-successful-mobile-app-are-almost-nil/">article</a>. From here and other sources it shows that to actually develop an app you need an initial investment of at least €25,000 and make it a full time job. Afterwards you need to invest in marketing and spend a lot of time adjusting ASO.</p>
<p>This is kinda outside the scope of what I want to do so I will not include it in my final outcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="poker-player" class="section level2">
<h2>Poker player</h2>
<p>Now let’s compute the outcome of ten thousand lives as a online poker player. For this we will need some additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the probability to make it as an professional online poker player</li>
<li>How much or how little does an online poker player make in a year</li>
<li>How is that money distributed</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumption can be estimated in multiple ways, although most of them are time consuming and the technical methods used are outside the scope of this article. However, I will briefly mention them if you are interested in such an endeavour.</p>
<p><a href="https://statname.net/">Statname.net</a> is one of the multiple sites that offer statistics regarding player earnings on different platforms and strategies. You can get the data from there on the earnings of a player, the number of hands and compute how much he would have earned if you account for the blinds. Then you can set a cut-off point in which an earning is considered a living wage and you can compute the percentage of professional players. This will be your probability. The same can go for the other measures.</p>
<p>Since getting the data can be a bit time consuming and this being just an example, I have decided to base my computations on the following <a href="https://www.blackrain79.com/">blog</a>. You can get a lot of useful information about online poker from here and I found it very useful, my understanding of poker being the as basic as it could be. From what I read here, and discussed this with people who know about the subject way more than I do, apparently one of the most successful strategies in online poker is to win blinds not large hands. The tables are also divided by the size of the blinds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>NL2 (also known as 2NL) = ¢1 / ¢2 blinds</li>
<li>NL5 (also known as 5NL) = ¢2 / ¢5 blinds</li>
<li>NL10 (also known as 10NL) = ¢5 / ¢10 blinds</li>
<li>NL25 (also known as 25NL) = ¢10 / ¢25 blinds</li>
<li>NL50 (also known as 50NL) = ¢25 / ¢50 blinds</li>
<li>NL100 (also known as 100NL) = ¢50 / $1 blinds</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, how do we transform this into earnings? The formula is simple as seen below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (winning\_big\_blinds\_chance \times big\_blind\_value) \times \frac{played\_hands}{100}  \]</span></p>
<p>Let’s compute some and example. From what I could gather a professional player will play around 100.000 hands a month. So from here on I will use this as the number of hands a professional player will play so we can estimate the winnings. With this in mind, let’s see how much will a professional player make from a NL2 table with a 30% win rate. That will translate into the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (30 \times 2) \times \frac{100000}{100} = ¢60000\]</span></p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that those are cents, adjusting to dollars, we see that you can earn around $600 a month playing low stakes poker, which is not bad. We also need to take into account that people can play multiple tables online and apparently most people do. So the probabilities that I am going to use here can be found in this <a href="https://www.blackrain79.com/2014/06/good-win-rates-for-micro-and-small_6.html">blog post</a> and are going to be just the ones for 1-8 tables since I already established that I will play around 100.000 hands a month so increasing the number of tables to 18+ cuts time but lower my attention and therefore the winning rate. If I want to maximise the number of hands, or increase the hourly payment I would increase the number of tables.</p>
<p>I will compute the average for each type of table, however I will transform the cents into dollars directly</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL2   = (10 \times \frac{2}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$200\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL5   = (6 \times \frac{5}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$300\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL10  = (4 \times \frac{10}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$400\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL25  = (3 \times \frac{25}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$750\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL50  = (2 \times \frac{50}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$1000 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL100 = (2 \times 1) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$2000 \]</span></p>
<p>Now that we have some averages, I would like to see how much can the best players make using the same estimates from the articles.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL2   = (30 \times \frac{2}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$600\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL5   = (10 \times \frac{5}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$900\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL10  = (12 \times \frac{10}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$1200\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL25  = (10 \times \frac{25}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$2500\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL50  = (9 \times \frac{50}{100}) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$4500 \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NL100 = (8 \times 1) \times \frac{100000}{100} = \$8000 \]</span></p>
<p>We can see that this is not anywhere near a normal distribution. By the definition of professional players, we know that they are the ones that actually earn enough so that they can survive of this income. This leaves us with a skewed distribution. I think we can safely assume that most professional players are average players and the elite that earn as much as we have shown here are a small percent 10%. With that said, we can start creating the population of online poker players.</p>
<p>Another assumption is that professional poker players will not spend all their time in NL2, NL5 and NL10 games, will most likely spend it on something that will provide more income. This is also consistent with the living wage assumption. I know $750 might not seem much in a month for most Western democracies, however, it is quite a decent income in second and third world countries. So, how are we going to do this?</p>
<p>Simple, we will create two distributions that will reflect the average player and the elite player. The first one will be 90% of the population and the second one will be the other 10%</p>
<pre class="r"><code>avg_player &lt;- rnorm(9000, 1400, 300)
elt_player &lt;- rnorm(1000, 4000, 1000)
poker_players &lt;- c(avg_player, elt_player)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>poker_players %&gt;% 
  histogram() +
  labs(title = &quot;Monthly Income Distribution&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Professional Poker Players&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>This distribution seems legit for a power law distribution. And now, for the final touch, we will need to add the 10% chance to become a professional player. We will do this by using the list we have created earlier. For this we will create a binomial distribution with a 10% probability and a size 1. Basically we can create a random string of values, either 1 or 0 and about 10% are one. Let’s see it in practice.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>success_prob &lt;- rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.1)
print(sum(success_prob) / 10000)</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; [1] 0.0985</code></pre>
<p>Perfect, 9.85% is exactly what we would expect.</p>
<p>Now all we need to do is multiply the two lists. When a value in the second list is 0 it will transform the earnings to 0, so we did not make it as a professional poker player. When it is 1 the result will not be affected.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>poker_players_final &lt;- poker_players * success_prob</code></pre>
<p>Now that we painfully and to the best of our knowledge created the populations, let’s proceed in analysing the data.</p>
