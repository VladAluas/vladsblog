As mentioned in the personal description, I am an opinionated prick, so this website is going to be used as a platform where I can go into more detail about said opinions. I will usually keep my opinions in the realm of data, data analysis, and data science. 

Besides that I will also post technical tutorials on how you can analyse and automate data analysis, data transfer, and data gathering using code. I usually use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) (with maybe some *SQL* for good measure) and for the technical articles I will expose the code. As a rule of thumb, that most likely will be broken, I will try to use the two languages as follows:

  -  **R**
      - data analysis
      - data manipulation
      - data visualisations 
    
  -  **Python**
      - engineering part (*e.g.* web scrapping)
      - machine learning
      
If you have any ideas for which you would like my input you can get in contact with me here.
